    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A delicious pasta and chicken dish with garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil. <br> Use the dry packaged
        sun-dried tomatoes instead of the tomatoes packed in olive oil.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sauce can be kept, covered, for one day in the refrigerator; heat again over low heat. <br> Try it with some
        crusty bread if desired.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>Â½ cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped </li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided </li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream </li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil </li>
        <li>8 ounces dry fettuccini pasta </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step</strong> <br> <br>
            In a large saucepan over low heat, melt butter; add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and 3/4
            cup of the chicken broth; increase to medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered,
            for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes are tender. Add the cream and bring to a boil; stirring. Simmer
            over medium heat until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>

        <li><strong>Step</strong> <br> <br>
            Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil and
            saute chicken. Press on chicken occasionally with a slotted spatula. Cook for about 4 minutes per side or
            until the meat feels springy and is no longer pink inside. Transfer to a board; cover and keep warm. Discard
            the fat from the skillet.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>

        <li><strong>Step</strong> <br> <br>
            In the same skillet, over medium heat, bring 1/4 cup chicken broth to a boil; stirring the pan juices.
            Reduce slightly and add to the cream sauce; stir in basil and adjust seasonings to taste.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>

        <li><strong>Step</strong> <br> <br>
            Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes
            or until al dente; drain, transfer to a bowl and toss with 3 to 4 tablespoons of the sauce.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>

        <li><strong>Step</strong> <br> <br>
            Cut each chicken breast into 2 to 3 diagonal slices. Reheat the sauce gently if needed. Transfer the pasta
            to serving plates; top with chicken and coat with the cream sauce; serve.
        </li>
